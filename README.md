# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset is from [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Steps
- Loaded and explored the data  
- Handled class imbalance using SMOTE  
- Trained and evaluated a Random Forest classifier  
- Improved results by tuning and sampling  

## How to run
- Mount Google Drive if using Colab  
- Upload the dataset to your drive  
- Run the notebook cells sequentially  

## Results
- Achieved good precision and recall for fraud detection  
- Model performance metrics shown in the notebook
